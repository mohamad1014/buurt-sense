Wire up real inference instead of the ambient-noise stub by adding a FastAPI inference module and replacing _infer_segment with model-backed detections (TFLite/YOLO/YAMNet, configurable thresholds and cooldown) in app/storage.py (line 264) and the development tasks outlined in README.md (lines 331-340).
Expand the browser client beyond the fixed defaults to expose controls for segment length/overlap/confidence and show live detection overlays + recording indicator; current payload is hard-coded in app/frontend/static/app.js (lines 200-217) and there’s no UI for configuration (README.md (lines 140-214)).
Add offline/PWA ergonomics: ensure MediaRecorder uploads queue/retry, persist metadata locally (IndexedDB) before POSTing, and prep for background capture/session resumes (README.md (lines 172-215)).
Introduce a pluggable storage layer so cloud/object storage backends can replace local disk/SQLite without touching route handlers (README.md (lines 259-263)).
Formalize privacy/retention decisions the code depends on (encryption at rest, auto-purge window, per-class thresholds) from the open questions in README.md (lines 389-399), then enforce them in storage and schemas.
Broaden tests to cover the above: model pipeline unit tests, frontend upload/e2e happy-path with the new config UI, and load/perf smoke tests for continuous capture (README.md (lines 342-347)).
